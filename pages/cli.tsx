 I'm Guillaume. Thank you for considering supporting my open-source software work through GitHub Sponsors.

I am a passionate full-stack web developer currently working on Mockoon in my spare time.

Mockoon is the easiest and quickest way to run mock APIs locally. No remote deployment or account required. And it's open-source!
I want Mockoon to be the best mocking tool out there! But this requires time. A lot of time.
By sponsoring me you can show your appreciation for all this hard work and also allow me to dedicate more time to this project in the future.

Thank you for considering support!
