        Sometimes you may need to mock only part of an API and forward the rest to an existing REST server. Fortunately, you can do this with Mockoon:
        <ol>
          <li>Open the <strong>environment settings</strong> by clicking on the cog in the upper right corner:</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <OpenSettingsGif />
      <div className="content">
        <ol>
          <li value="2">Enable <strong>proxy mode</strong> and enter the server URL to which you want to forward calls. A small shield icon should appear on the right of your environment name indicating that the proxy mode has been enabled:</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <Image src="/static/images/tutorials/enable-proxy-mode.gif" alt="Enable proxy mode" />
      <div className="content">
        <p>All routes that have been defined will be intercepted by Mockoon, and any other request will be forwarded to the server defined in the proxy mode setting.</p>
