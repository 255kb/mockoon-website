        For easier debugging, Mockoon logs all entering requests together with
        their respective outgoing responses for each of your environment. To
        access the logs it's very simple:
        <ol>
          <li>
            After selecting the environment you are interested in, open the{' '}
            <strong>logs</strong> by clicking on the clock icon in the upper
            right corner:
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <Image src='/images/tutorials/open-logs.gif' alt='Open logs' />
      <div className='content'>
        <p>
          You will see in the list all the intercepted requests and how Mockoon
          answered them, on the currently selected environment. Please note that
          all requests are intercepted even favicon requests made by browsers!
          You can also easily see if a request has been caught by Mockoon or
          passed to another URL if proxy mode is activated for the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complete headers list, route (URL) params, query params, and body in
          raw format are all included in the request's or response's details.
        </p>
      </div>
