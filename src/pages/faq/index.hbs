          <h3>How does Mockoon mocking works?</h3>
          <p>Unlike many other mocking tools, Mockoon uses a local server to avoid latency and the hassle of deploying through a remote service.</p>
          <h3>Does Mockoon require an active internet connection?</h3>
          <p>No, you don't need an internet connection to use Mockoon, everything runs locally.</p>
          <h3>Does Mockoon require an account?</h3>
          <p>No, you don't need to sign up or create an account to use Mockoon.</p>
          <h3>Is Mockoon free and/or open source?</h3>
          <p>Mockoon is 100% free AND open source (MIT license).</p>
          <h3>Where are my data stored?</h3>
          <p>Locally, in your operating system user data folder. "c:/.../Users/xxx/AppData/Roaming on Windows", "~/.config" on Linux and "~/Library/Application Support" on macOS.</p>
          <h3>Are you collecting usage data?</h3>
          <p>Yes, but only anonymous data through Google Analytics. Besides Google Analytics standard collected data (OS, screen size, etc.) we are also collecting some events happening in the application. A typical event includes the following JSON <code>{ category: 'delete', action: 'environment' }</code>, <code>{ category: 'server', action: 'start' }</code>, etc. None of your mock data, routes or URLs are collected.</p>
